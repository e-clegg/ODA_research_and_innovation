"1","2021-08-09T10:46:26.935000+00:00","Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is often mistaken for other common medical conditions, but if missed can cause considerable long-term disability. In severely poisoned patients, delayed treatment for CO poisoning can be fatal. For patients who are exposed to low-level CO, who often seek medical attention a number of times before the cause of the problem is recognised, delayed diagnosis can lead to long-term consequences such as memory and behavioural problems.    A number of studies have been undertaken in the US and Malta which have suggested that a small proportion of all patients who go to Emergency Departments (EDs) have evidence of CO poisoning (0.05% in one large study). However, specific patient groups have a much higher risk of CO poisoning; these include patients with flu-like symptoms, chronic bronchitis, chest pain, headache, and fits. Efforts have been made to devise systems to predict which patients are at risk of CO exposure but these have been shown to translate poorly to other healthcare systems.     There is little evidence about the proportion of people who go to EDs in the UK with CO exposure. This study proposes to measure the proportion of patients with the above symptoms, who may have been exposed to CO. Blood levels of CO can now be measured without taking a blood sample (ie without the need for a needle) by a clip-on device.  Patients who go to two EDs (one in inner London, one in Surrey) with the above symptoms would have their CO levels measured using the new technology and then complete a short questionnaire about potential sources of exposure to CO. It is intended to develop a prediction rule that will apply to all EDs in the UK, and a subsequent study will need to be performed to validate its use.","Policy Research Programme","GU16 7UJ","Researcher Led","Complete",51.319666,"002/0030","2009-05-01","Government/NHS","Surrey Heath","2011-06-30","Background  Both acute and chronic CO exposure can produce a wide variety of non-specific clinical features, all of which can mimic other pathologies. There is evidence to suggest that CO toxicity is frequently missed by healthcare professionals. Studies have been published in US and Malta which suggest that the prevalence of CO poisoning is low in an undifferentiated Emergency Department population but much higher in targeted groups (those showing clinical features that can be caused by CO). Prediction rules have been devised using identified risk factors for exposure but these have been found to be difficult to translate to different healthcare settings.  No such studies have been published in the UK.    Aims  1. To measure, non-invasively, CO levels in patients attending urban and rural EDs in England with specified presenting complaints: chest pain, exacerbation of COPD, flu-like symptoms, headache, and seizures.    2. To identify potential risk factors for CO exposure through questionnaires, and to assess if there is any difference in risk factors between patients in urban and rural areas.    3.  To devise a prediction model to assess risk of CO exposure in patients presenting to EDs. A subsequent study will be undertaken in other regions of the UK to validate the prediction model.    4. To establish a system for reporting CO-poisoning to public health professionals.    Plan of Investigation  Two EDs have been identified to participate in the study: Frimley Park Hospital and St Mary's Hospital, London. Patients who present with primary complaints of chest pain, exacerbation of COPD, flu-like symptoms, headache and seizures will be recruited. CO will be measured non-invasively by pulse co-oximetry when the patients first attend and a questionnaire completed regarding the patient's risk factors and potential confounders (eg smoking, heating system, mode of transport to the ED, occupation). A sample size calculation based on existing prevalence estimates indicates that at least 80 patients are needed in the headache group and 300 in the flu group (other groups lie between these figures). Public health professionals will be alerted about cases in order to protect those at risk.    Potential Impact  Missed CO poisoning was the most common clinical condition that I saw in Medical Toxicology at Guy's Hospital and the chronic sequelae were particularly debilitating for these people. Often, patients had sought medical attention a number of times before CO poisoning was recognised. It is likely that CO exposure is a significant health protection problem and that the patients seen in Toxicology Clinics represent the 'tip of the iceberg'. Development of a clinical prediction rule would raise awareness of this and increase the chance that these patients are identified earlier, resulting in reduced neurological impairment and earlier intervention to protect others at risk. Many of these patients present to EDs therefore targetting this setting would maximise the potential public health impact.","PRP","Research",158591,90545,
